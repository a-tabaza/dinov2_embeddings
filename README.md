# DINOv2 Features for Frame Retrieval

This is a really simple thing I did where I embedded the frames from RAN 1985 by Akira Kurosawa into a latent space using DINOv2. I then used the latent space to retrieve frames from the movie. The results are pretty cool.

I ran the code on the cloud, so the streamlit UI I had to pretend to embed each frame query by just looking up the embedding through the file name. x10 stuff you wouldn't get it.
